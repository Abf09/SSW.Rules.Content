Source control is the backup of your code, as well as your change history to track changes. 
<br>With the source control (we use TFS), we can share project code and cooperate with other team members. Using it allows us to track changes, compare code, and even roll-back if required. Moreover, it keeps our code safe that is the most important. <br> 
![View the changes in source control on each individual file](HistoryWindow.jpg)
![We can select different changesets and compare the changes](HistoryCompareMenu.jpg)
![We can select different changesets and compare the changes. Blue = modified, Green = addition, Red = deletion <br>](Compare.jpg)
 
![Right click file and select Annotate to view the history on a segment basis](AnnotateMenu.jpg)
![Use annotate to understand](Annotate.jpg)(or find the guy) to understand his thoughts before deleting/changing someone elses code
![Annotation is great, but it gets even better when one click gives you the 'check in comment' and the 'work item'](AnnotationAndComment.jpg)

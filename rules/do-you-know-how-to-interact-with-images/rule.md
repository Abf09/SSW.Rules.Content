There are three main ways of interacting with an image that is not an intended link on a website. 

* Clicking the image will open a larger scale version of the image in a new tab. (New Tab)
* Clicking the image will create a zoomed version of the image on the same page. (Zoom Control)
* No interaction at all. (No Interaction)

Each of these has a use and purpose depending on the time on the workflow of the user, and context of the image.  So when should I apply these interactions to an image?

## New Tab
New Tabs should be used when -
* It's an image from an external site
* It is a very high resolution image.
* It is a manual or instructions, or something that should interrupt the current workflow.
* It is an meant to be printed

## Zoom Control
Zoom Control should be used when -
* By default if the image has a larger scale to view.
* For accessibility reasons

## No Interaction
No interaction should be used when -
* The image is close to full scale already
* The image is more for style and decoration.






They all have a use depending on the context of the image and the workflow of the person using the website.

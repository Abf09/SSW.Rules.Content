There are three main ways of interacting with an image that is not an intended link on a website. 

* Clicking the image will open a larger scale version of the image in a new tab.
* Clicking the image will create a zoomed version of the image on the same page.
* No interaction at all.

Each of these has a use and purpose depending on the time on the workflow of the user, and context of the image.






They all have a use depending on the context of the image and the workflow of the person using the website.
